**Deployment plan:**

2. Run `gulp` to build project.
3. Run `gulp css:replace` to replace css (replace some src path in style).
4. Run `gulp webserver` to run webserver.
5. Check browser (it should open).

   Also you would use local or external links for demo and tests (see terminal).
   
   Also you can open _index.html_ in _/build_ directory for see page offline.
6. Done.

For delete all the assets: `gulp clean`.
